# Programming Project - Week 6 and Beyond

## This is a test for the programming project GitHub repository.

There is currently no proper file in this repository, but there is a test space invaders folder with processing files for you to test how GitHub works. 

Currently, when you join the repository as a contributor you should be able to edit and upload files to the repository. -- When you open a folder (press its name to open it), and a file, there should be a pen button on the right-hand side of the screen that allows you to make changes to the code we have. There are better ways to do this, but most of us probably don't know how to use GitHub so this is the best we have without any knowledge.
