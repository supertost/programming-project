# Programming Project - Week 6 and Beyond

## This is a test for the programming project GitHub repository.

There is currently no proper file in this repository, but there is a test space invaders folder with processing files for you to test how GitHub works. 

### ! There is a Github Desktop application that allows you to clone everything in the repository to your PC and upload directly to the repository, please download it.

### Please also download VS Code as well, it will be much easier to write the code itself from vscode and use processing to just run the code itself. (Not Mandatory though -- You'll see why after reading the instructions for the Github desktop)

## Github Desktop program instructions on how to use with this repository

After installing the Github desktop app, you will be prompted to login to your account. After you login you will be able to pick this repository to clone on your computer.

After you clone the repository to your prefered location in your computer, you will be able to automatically open it in VS Code, but if you do not want to open it from VS Code you can just manually open the files from file explorer.

When you make changes to the code on your computer, the github desktop app will show you the changes you make, when you're done with what you're doing, you can open the Github desktop app, press "Commit to main" in the lower left hand side of the window and then press "Push commits to the origin". Pressing this button will replace the file in the repository with the one you have edited.

There will also be a short photo tutorial under the "Github Desktop Tutorial" folder.

### Besides the test folder and files, the project files along with the instructions for the actual project is located under the "Project Resources" folder.
